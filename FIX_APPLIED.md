# ✅ PROBLEM FIXED!

## Issue You Were Facing

**Error**: `Failed to parse source for import analysis because the content contains invalid JS syntax`

**Cause**: Vite requires JSX files to use the `.jsx` extension when using JSX syntax (React components with HTML-like code).

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Renamed** `App.js` → `App.jsx`
2. ✅ **Updated** `main.jsx` to import from `App.jsx`
3. ✅ **Deleted** old `App.js` file

## Now Try This

### Step 1: Restart the Dev Server

If your dev server is still running, stop it (Ctrl+C) and restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open in Browser

Your app should now load at: **http://localhost:5174** (or the port shown in terminal)

### Step 3: Test the App

1. ✅ Search by title: "Harry Potter"
2. ✅ Switch to Author: "J.K. Rowling"
3. ✅ Switch to Subject: "Science Fiction"
4. ✅ Click any book to see details
5. ✅ Check search history

## Why This Happened

**Vite's Import Analysis**: When Vite sees JSX syntax (like `<div>`, `<button>`, etc.) in a `.js` file, it gets confused. JSX needs to be in `.jsx` files so Vite knows to transform it properly.

**Best Practice**: 
- Use `.jsx` for React components with JSX
- Use `.js` for plain JavaScript files

## File Changes Summary

### Before:
```
src/
├── App.js        ← ❌ Had JSX in .js file
└── main.jsx
```

### After:
```
src/
├── App.jsx       ← ✅ JSX in .jsx file
└── main.jsx
```

## Still Having Issues?

If you still see errors:

1. **Clear Vite Cache**:
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   # Delete these folders:
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   rm -rf dist
   # Restart
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Hard Refresh Browser**:
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

3. **Check Console**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any red errors
   - Share them if you need more help
